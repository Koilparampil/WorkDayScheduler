## Description

This page was designed to help plan a Person's day. My goal was to utilize local storage JQuery and  Moment.js to build something dynamic. 

## Technology

JQuery, Font Awesome, Moment.js, and bootstrap


## Usage

After landing on the page you will be presented with the workday split into 1-hour Timeslots. The current hour will be shown in red, future hours will be shown in green, and past hours will be shown in grey.

Write a message in the middle column and save it to the local storage with the save button on the right.

## Installation

No steps are required for installation, Everything works on the front end and there is no real back-end to talk about. You can clone this repo to your own github and deploy to pages immediately.

## Credits
I would like to thank [klangs34](https://github.com/klangs34) for a good starting point from which I was able to create the rest of the code. 
I would also like to thank W3Schools for their various tutorials about bootstrap classes.
